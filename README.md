## "Use HTML, CSS"
***
## The challenge
In this exercise you will build two full integrations.
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia).
Create a standard style.css stylesheet and link it to the html page
Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided mockup images.
